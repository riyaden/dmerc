        <h1 align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3">Understanding HIPAA:<br>
        An Overview of Administrative Simplification</font></h1>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Among the multiple priorities and
        constraints facing the healthcare industry, healthcare providers and
        other organizations can expect a new tidal wave of change brought on by
        the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
        President Clinton signed HIPAA (also known as the Kennedy-Kassebaum
        bill) into law in August 1996. The intent of the legislation was to
        improve the portability and continuity of health benefits, to ensure
        greater accountability in the area of health care fraud, and to simplify
        the administration of health insurance. In Title II of the Act, a
        subsection entitled Administrative Simplification has resulted in new
        regulations mandating compliance with a wide range of health information
        management, security and privacy standards.</font></p>
        <h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Administrative Simplification</font></h3>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The Administrative Simplification section
        was included in HIPAA with the intent to standardize specific electronic
        transactions and identifiers used in healthcare business processes such
        as billing, claims, and other interactions between providers,
        clearinghouses, and health plans. It is expected that by making business
        practices more uniform, costs due to duplication of effort,
        modifications of procedures, errors and delays will be substantially
        reduced. The framers of HIPAA anticipated that these improvements would
        encourage the use of electronic data interchange (EDI) in healthcare,
        and result in the eventual replacement of paper-based transactions. They
        also recognized that healthcare's growing reliance on EDI necessitates
        the use of strong protections to ensure patient privacy and the
        security, integrity, and authenticity of health information. Central to
        this concern was the concept of protecting "individually
        identifiable health information" — any information, including
        demographic information, that refers to an individual's past, present or
        future health, and identifies an individual, or that could be useful in
        identifying an individual.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The Administrative Simplification section
        of HIPAA mandated the following:</font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Adoption of standards for electronic
            transmission of nine designated health care transactions and related
            code sets</font>
          </li><li><font face="Arial" size="3">Establishment of unique national
            identifiers of employers, health plans, health providers and
            individuals</font>
          </li><li><font face="Arial" size="3">Adoption of security standards to
            protect health information</font>
          </li><li><font face="Arial" size="3">Enactment by Congress of privacy
            legislation — or, failing this — promulgation of privacy
            standards by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)</font></li>
        </ul>
        <h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Electronic Transactions and Code Sets
        Standards</font></h3>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">If EDI is employed in conducting
        healthcare business, the following nine transactions require the use of
        HIPAA standards for encoding the data elements defined by the
        transactions. If healthcare organizations are not conducting business
        via electronic transactions, use of these standards is not required.</font></p>
        <ol>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Health claims or equivalent encounter
            information</font>
          </li><li><font face="Arial" size="3">Health claims attachments</font>
          </li><li><font face="Arial" size="3">Enrollment and disenrollment</font>
          </li><li><font face="Arial" size="3">Eligibility for a health plan</font>
          </li><li><font face="Arial" size="3">Payment and remittance advice</font>
          </li><li><font face="Arial" size="3">Health plan premium payments</font>
          </li><li><font face="Arial" size="3">First report of injury</font>
          </li><li><font face="Arial" size="3">Health claims status</font>
          </li><li><font face="Arial" size="3">Referral certification and
            authentication</font></li>
        </ol>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In addition, HIPAA gave the Secretary of
        Health and Human Resources the option to adopt other financial and
        administrative transactions standards, "consistent with the goals
        of improving the operation of the health care system and reducing
        administrative costs."</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Administrative Simplification also
        included provisions requiring that DHHS establish standards for code
        sets that would be used in the standard transactions. The Secretary was
        directed to find efficient, low-cost means for distributing code sets
        and any future modifications to them.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The final Transactions Rule, detailing
        each standard, was published in August of 2000, with compliance required
        by October of 2002.</font></p>
        <h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Unique Health Identifiers</font></h3>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The Secretary of Health and Human
        Services was also required to adopt standards that would provide for
        unique, national identifiers for providers, employers, health plans and
        individuals to be used within the healthcare system. Provider and
        Employer Identifier Standards (NPRMs) were proposed in 1998, and DHHS
        has indicated that final rules will be published in 2001. A proposed
        rule for Health Plan Identifier is also expected in 2001. The Individual
        Identifier, the subject of intense public scrutiny and controversy, is
        "on hold," according to DHHS.</font></p>
        <h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Security Standards for Health
        Information</font></h3>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">HIPAA also mandates that DHHS establish
        health information security regulations. As it applies to HIPAA,
        "security" refers to the means by which organizations and
        people ensure the privacy and confidentiality of health care
        information. Security addresses "how" information is to be
        protected from inappropriate use. "What" data is to be
        considered private and confidential is broader than the information used
        in standard HIPAA transactions. It applies to any and all individually
        identifiable health information that is maintained or transmitted
        electronically by healthcare entities.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">HIPAA specifically charged the Secretary
        with taking into account the costs of security measures, the technical
        capabilities of record systems used, the need for training those with
        access to health information, the value of audit trails, and "the
        needs and capabilities of small and rural healthcare providers."
        Safeguards were mandated in order to ensure the integrity and
        confidentiality of information, to protect against security threats and
        unauthorized uses or disclosures of the information, and to ensure that
        all healthcare workers and managers comply with the standards.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">A draft of the Security Rule (NPRM) was
        published in August 1998. According to DHHS, the final rule will be
        released before the end of 2001, and is expected to be substantially the
        same as the proposed rule. In its security proposal, DHHS' draft
        regulations were presented in the following four categories, as required
        by HIPAA:</font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Administrative procedures</font>
          </li><li><font face="Arial" size="3">Physical safety guidelines<br>
            </font>
          </li><li><font face="Arial" size="3">Technical security services</font>
          </li><li><font face="Arial" size="3">Technical security mechanisms</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The Security regulations have been
        developed as guidelines that set a baseline for compliance. Requirements
        are focused on outcomes rather than specific technologies or
        methodologies, because of the variety of healthcare operations and the
        changing nature of technology as a whole. Organizations are expected to
        assess their individual security vulnerabilities and risks, and
        implement programs and protocols they deem appropriate, for their
        organization, to meet all the security requirements.</font></p>
        <h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Electronic Signature</font></h3>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">As required by the Administrative
        Simplification section of HIPAA, the proposed Security Rule included
        standards for the uses of electronic transmission and authentication of
        signatures. DHHS has announced that the final Security Rule will not
        include these provisions, and that work is underway to develop final
        electronic signature standards in the next year. It should be noted that
        neither the Act nor the proposed Security Rule requires the use of
        electronic signatures. The intent has been to standardize their use if
        an organization is employing them.</font></p>
        <h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Privacy</font></h3>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">HIPAA mandated that Congress pass health
        privacy legislation, but Congress was unable to meet its August 1999
        deadline. Therefore, as provided in the Act, DHHS issued draft privacy
        regulations via an NPRM in November 1999. The final Privacy Rules was
        published in December 2000 and went into effect in April 2001.
        Compliance is required in April 2003.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The purpose of the Privacy Rule is to
        protect the rights and control of individuals with respect to their
        individually identifiable health information. HIPAA specifically noted
        that the Privacy Rule should, at a minimum, address the nature of these
        individual rights, procedures for exercising them, and which uses and
        disclosures by healthcare entities should be authorized or required. The
        final Privacy Rule identifies who has access to what health care data,
        clarifies patients' rights of control over their health care data,
        offers definitions of inappropriate access and use, and determines
        accountability for protecting patient privacy. Areas covered include:</font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Authorization and consent processes
            for accessing personal health data</font>
          </li><li><font face="Arial" size="3">The right of a patient to inspect
            his/her medical record and request amendments to it</font>
          </li><li><font face="Arial" size="3">Delineation of direct patient care use
            of information from non-patient care use<br>
            </font>
          </li><li><font face="Arial" size="3">Increased requirements to notify
            patients as to how their information is being used</font>
          </li><li><font face="Arial" size="3">Requirements to maintain an accurate
            history of access to a patient's health information in the event of
            a disclosure</font></li>
        </ul>
        <h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Who is Affected by HIPAA?</font></h3>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In general, all healthcare organizations,
        including health plans, providers, and clearinghouses that
        electronically transmit or store individually identifiable health
        information are covered by HIPAA. In addition, employers and healthcare
        vendors are affected. For specific applicability of each HIPAA rule,
        refer to the text of the respective rule.</font></p>
        <h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Compliance Timetable</font></h3>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Covered entities must be in compliance
        with each of HIPAA's rules no later than 24 months after the date the
        rule went into effect. However, in the case of small health plans that
        have fewer than 50 members, the compliance deadline is extended to 36
        months after the effective date.</font></p>
        <h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Additions and Modifications to Standards</font></h3>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">HIPAA mandates that the Secretary of
        Health and Human Services review the standards, and adopt modifications
        as appropriate, no more often than once every 12 months and in a manner
        that minimizes disruption and cost. The Secretary may not make any
        modifications during the 12 months following the effective date of a
        particular rule, unless the Secretary "determines that the
        modification is necessary in order to permit compliance."</font></p>
        <h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Sanctions and Penalties</font></h3>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Penalties established for non-compliance
        with HIPAA's requirements are:</font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Personal liability: individuals may be
            liable for up to 10 years in prison and $250,000 in fines for
            intentional misuse of protected health information</font>
          </li><li><font face="Arial" size="3">Organizational liability: Healthcare
            organizations are liable for up to $25,000 in fines for each
            standard violated</font></li>

        Implementation of the information security and privacy features in HIPAA
        will pave the way for increasingly sophisticated e-health and other
        healthcare e-commerce and communications applications — as well as for
        new uses of evolving technologies, such as hand-held devices and
        wireless access. In order to realize these potential benefits — and to
        ensure that official compliance deadlines are met — healthcare
        organizations should begin immediately to assess their current
        information environment and develop strategies for HIPAA implementation.</font></p>

        entities will face the following challenges as they begin to prepare for
        compliance:</b></font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Developing policies and procedures
            to determine the <i>minimum necessary</i> information each
            department or job needs.</b> You cannot use or share a patient’s
            entire medical record without specific justification.</font>
          </li><li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Obtaining and tracking patient
            consent.</b> With a few limited exceptions, you must obtain prior
            consent to use or disclose PHI for treatment, payment, or other
            health care operations. This consent may be combined with other
            types of legal permission, such as informed consent for treatment or
            consent to assignment of benefit forms, if the PHI disclosure
            consent is visually and organizationally separate from the rest of
            the information on the form and is separately signed.</font>
          </li><li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Obtaining authorization forms and
            assuring compliance with particular authorizations.</b> The Privacy
            Standards require the patient to authorize all PHI uses and
            disclosures unconnected to treatment, payment, or health care
            operations.</font>
          </li><li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Reconciling multiple
            consent/authorization forms.</b> A patient may end up signing
            multiple consent forms, particularly in situations where several
            providers in one setting treat him or her. If you are part of an
            organized health care arrangement, you may obtain a joint consent
            for use and disclosure of PHI. In cases of conflicting consents, use
            the more restrictive consent.</font>
          </li><li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Monitoring business associate
            relationships.</b> The Privacy Standards require that covered
            entities ensure that their <i>business associates</i> (those who
            receive PHI in the course of providing services in the assistance to
            a covered entity) use appropriate safeguards by including
            requirements on how PHI will be handled in contracts with
            associates. Examples of business associates include consultants,
            auditors, and attorneys. You may need to review multiple
            relationships and monitor your business associates’ compliance
            with the contract’s requirements to protect your business.</font>
          </li><li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Changing medical records
            maintenance.</b> The Privacy Standards may alter how you maintain
            your medical records so that you can document compliance with the
            standards’ minimum necessary information, PHI use disclosure, and
            patient access requirements.</font>
          </li><li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Providing privacy policy notice.</b>
            If you have a direct treatment relationship with a patient, you must
            notify the patient of your company’s privacy practices in
            "plain language" by the date of the first service delivery
            (including services delivered electronically). The notice must also
            be available at the service delivery site for distribution upon
            request and posted in a prominent location.</font>
          </li><li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Meeting overall training
            requirements.</b> You must complete training of your workforce on
            the Privacy Standards by April 14, 2003, the standards’ compliance
            date.</font>
          </li><li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Responding to individual rights.</b>

          </li><li><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Amending</i>. They may request

            an accounting of their PHI disclosures for a period of up to 6 years
